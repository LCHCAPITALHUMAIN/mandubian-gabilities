# Mandubian GData Groovy Abilities #
## In a summary ##
  * Some **Groovy category classes** providing some facilities for **Google Data Client Apis**
  * A **Maven Project** showing the use of Maven with Groovy and also integrating with my GDataAPI mavenized cludge repository [mandubian-mvn](http://code.google.com/p/mandubian-mvn)
  * Some **JUnit tests** to provide samples and tests
  * Groovy code using **multiple assignment feature** thus returning several parameters from a function and preventing use of application exceptions or specific structures

## Current Status ##
The current version is just a draft integrating only:
  * Google Docs API
  * Google Spreadsheet API

It has been tested with:
  * Eclipse Galileo 3.5
  * M2eclipse
  * Subclipse
  * Groovy Eclipse Plugin 2-beta
  * Groovy 1.7-beta1 (multiple assignments issues with 1.6.x)

There are some already known [issues](http://code.google.com/p/mandubian-gabilities/issues/list)
